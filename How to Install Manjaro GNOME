Example Scenario: Sole Windows user migrates from Windows 10 to Windows 10 + Manjaro GNOME

GNOME(dual boot) on laptop

You don’t need to stick to this. For 1000 people, there are 1000 Manjaros. 
If more explanation is needed, please contribute or refer to Google search. Contribution is always welcome. 

Before: backup important files, Firefox bookmarks(library->bookmarks->show all bookmarks->import and backup->backup) check one more time that nothing you need/will need is left behind and removed forever 

(for dual-booting Windows) first install Windows and configure: UEFI, Disk Management 
1. Download Manjaro Linux GNOME from the official homepage and make the corresponding bootable USB with Rufus. 
2. Reboot and enter BIOS settings (e.g. Press F2). Check UEFI, Secure Boot. In this scenario, UEFI on & Secure Boot off. 
3. Install Manjaro Linux GNOME with the graphical installer. [2]
4. Update & upgrade system up-to-date, check pamac settings, and use pamac as much as possible(to make sure the system is up-to-date(Manjaro: rolling release)), if you use pacman and you don’t know well about Manjaro, use -Syu option!
5. Backup your Manjaro account’s ID, PW, and root PW 
6. (Disable user feedbacks for privacy) 
7. gufw: make sure gufw auto-start on startup[7]
8. time: Manjaro uses UTC, Windows uses RTC. Make Windows use UTC and hit the synchronize button of Windows. 
9. Firefox settings: (refer to privacytools.io, Youtube videos for privacy +) restore your bookmarks [9]
10. Libreoffice writer: set your preferences(+ disable autocorrect-word completion and delete all the history for potential privacy threat)
11. set uim for multilanguage input support. uim byeoru works well for Korean input. And install fonts.[11]
12. keyboard shortcuts: remove the unnecessary 
13. vim settings: refer to Youtube video like: add_ide_features_to_vim, etc.
14. Encrypted DNS Settings 
15. Restore files from your backup storage 
16. battery: laptop lid/power button actions/screen light-out/suspend: sleep, shutdown, disable hibernation[16]
17. brightness & night light(5000K~6000K might be your sweet spot) 
18. Go through your GNOME system settings[18]
19. Initial Setup is Done. You can change settings whenever you want!

appendix 1. how to use different keybind: 
a) xmodmap -pke > ~/.Xmodmap b) edit ~/.Xmodmap(use xev to figure out the keycodes) c) check ~/.xinitrc to ensure that X11 starts with the changed .Xmodmap(cf. usermodmap, sysmodmap, if [ -f "$usermodmap" ]; then xmodmap "$usermodmap" fi) 

if these don't work(my GNOME didn't work), then:
edit /usr/share/X11/xkb/keycodes/evdev instead of ~/.Xmodmap 

appendix 2. tldr, fortune would help a lot.

appendix 3. If you are going to use Joplin(open-source note-taking app), check https://github.com/laurent22/joplin and execute Joplin_install_and_update.sh

appendix 4. customize clipboard example: right-click clipboard -> configure clipboard -> uncheck Save clipboard contents on exit, check Prevent empty clipboard/Ignore images/Ignore selection and change Clipboard history size to 5.

\# after installation, before reboot, type efibootmgr command into the terminal and check BootOrder. If not correct, go into BIOS settings and fix it.

for Hangul(Korean) input:

\# $ vim ~/.profile
export GTK_IM_MODULE=uim
export QT_IM_MODULE=uim
uim-xim &
export XMODIFIERS=@im=uim
\#\# below are useless if GNOME doesn't use xmodmap.

xmodmap -e 'keycode 105 = Hangul_Hanja'

uncheck Enable IM switching by hotkey
uncheck Enable input method toggle by hot keys
in Byeoru key bindings 1 menu,
[Byeoru] on "hangul"

[Byeoru] convert Hangul to Chinese characters "hangul-hanja"

\# install fonts

\# install tlp, and then systemctl enable tlp --now (if tlp's version is 1.2.2 or lower, tlp needs tlp-sleep.service also.)
